## Functionality
The script was founded upon the basis of a pseudo employee terminal for a Rolex botique, containing the following features:
* A GUI (Graphical user interface) login system. 
* Ability to check the price of any Rolex watch given its collection and model number (e.g Submariner, m116610lv-0002). 

## Documentation Standards
The script utilizes the [Numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) documentation standards, as this is among one of the main standards used in the industry.
