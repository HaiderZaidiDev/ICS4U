# ICS4U: Documentation Assignment
This script was completed as part of a documentation assignment in ICS4U to demonstrate
the use of following documentation standards for a programming language. 

## Functionality
The script was founded upon the basis of an employee terminal for a Rolex botique, containing the following features:
* A GUI (Graphical user interface) login system. 
* Ability to check the price of any Rolex watch given its collection and model number (e.g Submariner, m116610lv-0002). 

## Documentation Standards
The script utilizes the [Numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) documentation standards, as this is among one of the main standards used in the industry. 


The script was created on a Windows 10 based system running 3.6.0, with 16 GB of DDR4 Ram and an i7-8700k, however, any system 
should be able to easily run this.
